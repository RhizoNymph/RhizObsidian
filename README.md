# RhizObsidian

This is a plugin for whatever I want to do in obsidian because categorizing functionalities seems like a fool's errand.


Right now all it does is give you a button to fetch ZK Podcast episodes and put the transcript into a note in Sources/Podcasts/ZK Podcast/Episodes.


To install, clone this into your obsidian vaults .plugins directory and run npm install followed by npm run dev. AFTER doing that, start obsidian.
